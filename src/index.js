// This code initializes a React application, rendering the main `App` component wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` to manage the application's theme context. The `index.css` file is imported for global styles, and the application is rendered into the root element of the HTML document. The use of `React.StrictMode` helps identify potential problems in the application during development.
// The `ThemeProvider` allows the application to access and toggle between dark and light themes, enhancing user experience by providing a consistent theming mechanism across the app.
// The `ReactDOM.createRoot` method is used to create a root for the React application, enabling concurrent features and improved performance.
// This setup is essential for building a modern React application with theming capabilities and a structured routing system.
// This is the main entry point for the React application.
